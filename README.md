How to Play Game (Instructions via CommandPrompt):
1) welcomes user to game
2) asks user to give a bet value
3) provides value of tokens + hand of cards
4) asks user if they want to keep card in hand (x5)
5) shows updated deck of cards, identifies hand, and shows updated points
5) asks user if they want to play again


Poker Program:
The Poker Game is made up of four classes: Card, Deck, Player, and Game; 
when designing this program, the bottom-up approach is used to make decisions 
at lower-levels and to be able to re-use components from lower classes.


Card.java
* Card class implements the Comparable Interface to be able to later use the compareTo() method

* Two private instance variables are defined: suit and rank 
    * suit will run from 1-4 & rank will run from 1-13
    
 * Card constructor is created which takes in local parameters of s, r 
    * compareTo() method - used to compare value of cards & to sort them in ranks
    * creates integer called value in order to compare String parameters 
    * the first condition used for sorting is by the rank(or value) of the numbers
      and is denoted through an if, else if, and else statments
        * if implicit value of rank < explicit value of rank
            *then it sets the value to 1
        * if implicit = explicit
            *then it uses another if, else if, else block 
            to create a hierarchy based on suits
            * if implicit < explicit, then value is set to -1, meaning
            * else if explicit > implicit, then value is set to 1, meaning
            * else explicit = implicit, then value is set to 0, meaning
        * else (meaning explicit > implicit) the value would be equal to 1
     * value is then returned
     
  * toString() method - creates an array to print out descriptions of cards
      * creates ranks and suits arrays
      * String called description concatenates element in suits and element in ranks and returns description

  * getSuit() and getRank() are accessor methods that return suit and rank


Deck.java
* Deck class has a constructor and 2 mutator methods

* Two private instance variables: Array from Card class called cards and an integer called top

* Constructor - makes the 52 card deck 
    * top = 0
    * 52 cards are declared in array
    * nested for loop is implemented to create a deck of 52 cards with 13 ranks made within 4 different suits

* shuffle() method is what shuffles the deck
    * two integers are created (pos1, pos2)
    * for loop has 1000 iterations or "shuffles"
        * pos1 + pos2 are declared to a random position from 0 to 52
        * temporary variable (temp) is created to hold replacement value
        * cards are shuffled using indexes generated by Random function
        
* deal() method is what deals the top card in the deck
    * top integer is added by 1 when method is invoked
    * if the value of top goes above 52, it shuffles the deck and sets top to 1
    * returns the top card



Game.java
* Game is the class that runs the operations of the games

*Four private instance variables are created: 
    * ply which is the player from player class
    * cards (deck of cards) from Deck class
    * input from imported Scanner class
    * payment which is of type double

* Game constructor takes in testHand parameter which holds the test deck of cards
    * instance variables are initialized 
    * integers s and r are declared & initiatlized to calculate values of suits + ranks
    * for loop is created to match suit to a numeric value between 1 -4
      from String (using subString method) & uses subString
      to convert rank from String to Integer and saves in r
    * addCard() method called and adds new Card with s and r integers calculated previously
    

* play() method is what goes through the motions of the game and provides user prompts
    * counter variable determines if game runs
    * when counter equals 1, prompts user to give input between 1-5 tokens
    * uses while statment to ensure user prompts a value between 1-5
    * once entered, calls bet method to subtract bet from total tokens
    * updates player’s bank roll by invoking
    * shuffles cards 
    * checks if size of hand is greater than 0 and sorts the hand given in command-line
        * else, calls initialDeal() method
    * called finalizeHand() which switches cards + prints latest  card
    * shows user what their hand is
    * updates their payment and shows user their current bank roll
    * asks user if they want to play again and receives user input
    * clear menthod is invoked that resets the hand
       
    
* checkHand() method takes in an ArrayList of the Card type 
   as an input and then determines the type of hand in deck 
   and returns to user through a String
   * creates varibale String result and returns the hand to user that matches the hand
 
* getPayment() is a public accessor method that returns payment variable

* initialDeal() method deals an initial set of 5 cards by invoking deal 
  method from Card class and invokes the sort hand method
  
* finalizeHand() method prompts the player and asks them if they want to keep their card
    * creates a counter for a for loop to iterate through each of 5 cards
        * creates latest variable to call card and asks user if they want to keep 
          and if so, invokes deal method
    * breaks out of loop and completes switching and sorts Hand
          
* the following methods are created to identify which hand is found in the deck:
    * royalFlush() - ensures if it is a normal flush and then checks if it starts with 10
    * straightFlush() - checks if straight and flush methods apply
    * fourOfAKind()- compares first 4 elements or second 4 elements are the same
    * fullHouse() - compares first 3 and 2 or first 2 and last 3 for similarity
    * flush() - iterates through hand to see if all suits are same
    * straight()- checks if hand increments by 1 from 1st card to 5th card
    * threeOfAKind() - checks if 3 cards are equal
    * twoPair() - uses pair integer to calculate if there are two pairs of same cards
    * onePair() - checks for one duplicate
    * highCard() - if all test fails
    

Player.java
* this class creates actions based on player’s properties of their hand

* three private instance variables are created:
  * hand - instance of array card
  * bankroll - total amount of money/points that user had
  * bet - value of bet  
* constructor creates player
* addCard() - method that adds card to player’s hand
* removeCard() - method that removes card from player’s hand
* bets() - invoked when player makes bet, passes amt 
  which is the bet and removes bet value from bankroll 
* winnings() - invoked hwen player wins and updates bankroll by adding bet*odds
* getBankroll() and getHand() - accesor. methods that return values
* sortHand()method - uses Collections framework to store sorted hands
* toString() - returns String description of deck of cards
